            The canvas "With Love" is a unique participatory art project where artists collaboratively create a symbolic canvas measuring 2.5 by 2.5 meters. 
            <br />
            Each participant contributes a loving addition to the design, which will ultimately be divided into small squares to be sewn together. 
            <br />
            <br />
            In this way, we collectively bring to life a powerful image of recovery, hope, and connection for Ukraine. 
            <br />

            Olena placed a map of Ukraine higher, and attached the ribbons to a large tree whose roots flow into rivers and surround the land. 
            She drew a sun with rays of grain. 
            <br />
            <br />
            ‘My Ukraine is feminine! Despite the fact that I have been living in a second country for many years, 
            I always remember and honour my roots, my native land. This is what now binds all women who have been scattered around the world so closely! 
            Like the sun, this love for Ukraine warms and shines in our hearts. And our seeds of love will sprout, 
            giving a great harvest of support and faith in the best future for our homeland!’

              I drew Ukraine as she is since the last independence: as a 33-year-old young woman. 
              She is everywhere without you seeing her. She flows throughout the country. 
              That is why I extracted the rivers from the map and wanted her to flow everywhere.
              The stork as a friend and symbol is inseparable. Her ribbons are as ubiquitous as her rivers flow.'
