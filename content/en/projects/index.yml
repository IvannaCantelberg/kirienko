            These canvases are sewn by women in Ukraine, made from unused remnants from curtain shops. 
            Since the invasion, my art has taken on a new dimension, as everything now revolves around: everyone does what they can, and everyone plays their role. 
            Art has become a powerful means for me to contribute.

        Life Force, one of my works, captures my feelings and insights surrounding the invasion. 
        This canvas is available by invitation as a source of strength for Ukrainians and for events and exhibitions to 
        keep attention on the situation in Ukraine alive...

        This is a participatory art project in which anyone who wants to can contribute based on the belief

        Together, we continue to envision the future of Ukraine as we love it, even for those who cannot do so temporarily...Â
