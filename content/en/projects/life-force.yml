sectionTitle: Life Force
description: |
      Full of Ukrainian symbols, ‘Life Force (is indestructible)’ is a textile artwork that
      expresses my feelings and understanding of the invasion of Ukraine. 
      <br><br>
      The canvas, made entirely by hand from leftover fabrics, symbolises the inner strength and resilience
      of the Ukrainian community.
      A bomb never goes as deep as the roots, so (an attempt) to
      destroy it is futile. 
      <br>
      This work acts as a source of strength and support, specifically
      created to inspire Ukrainians and give them hope in these difficult times. 
      <br><br>
      The canvas
      is available for events or exhibitions where it can serve as a source of strength and
      a reminder of the ongoing struggle for freedom. 
      <br><br>
      I use the Life Force canvas as a
      speaker, talking about the war in Ukraine based on individual

    title: Creation Story
    img:
    description: |
            The war began for me with a message at 4:30 in the morning from Luda, a seamstress from a
            border region in Ukraine: <strong>"They are bombing us."</strong> 
            <br><br>
            From that first morning, I started the blog "Voices from Ukraine," where I shared the experiences of
            five women from there. My personal journey towards creating this piece of art, "Life Force (indestructible)," also began at that moment. 
            Around the third day of the war, sitting with my
            knees drawn up on the couch, I realized: <em>after the bombs, grass will still grow</em>.
            <br><br>
            Destruction is both nonexistent and futile. The will to live in this world cannot be destroyed:
            "You cannot fight against the strength of life." This applies to both the destroyed nature and the
            desire to annihilate a people. No bomb can reach as deep as the roots go.
            <br><br>
            For months, we were inactive. They, the women, because they were surrounded, under bombardment,
            and in shelters. I, because each day was filled with aid and shock. After months of self-reflection
            and drawing, "The Life Force" emerged from within. This artwork is more than just a painting;
            it is a message of hope and resilience.
            <br>
            For Luda, who sewed it, this canvas became extraordinarily significant. Even when there was no
            electricity due to the bombings, she continued to sew by hand. She fully identified herself with the
            sorrow and inner strength of the woman in the painting. She says: <em>"She is us."</em> She fell on
            the sketch when she learned her husband and son had been sent to the front in Bakhmut, the hottest
            spot in Ukraine. She sewed the canvas when she learned that her son, Myroslav, had died. She also
            hopes the canvas will continue to tell the story of what is happening in Ukraine. 
            <br><br>
            This canvas travels to places where Ukrainians are temporarily located, hoping to remind them of their
            strength.
            <br>
            I also speak about the blog and the women from the blog. Thus, it travels with me. You could call it
            a traveling source of strength.

    title: Symbolism of Life Force

          This is an explosion in the darkness. The faded life forms within the explosion represent Ukrainian
          flora, symbolizing what is "lost" in the blast. Through the depth of the roots, I show how deeply
          our roots lie within us, nourished by the power of light: Light, Strength.
          <br>
          You might also see a woman with a traditional Ukrainian wreath. In that case, she represents
          Ukrainian fury and resilience.
          <br><br>
          The flying birds become eyes. I noticed that after the first bomb strike in a city or village, birds
          are always the first to flee. But you might also see it as if my own head has "exploded."

    title: Storks

    description: |
          Among everything happening, the fate of the storks troubled me. Every year, storks return to
          Ukraine. Storks are very loyal both to each other and to their nests. Thus, the stork is
          a Ukrainian symbol of fidelity and family happiness.
          <br><br>
          A stork's nest on your house is a blessing. Together with Ukraine, they now share a similar fate.
          <br>
          Due to numerous bombings, many nests have been disturbed or destroyed, and a new phenomenon has
          emerged — wandering, lonely storks without nests and without partners.
          They walk and walk, across fields, along roads.

    title: Foundations
    img: /img/projects/life-force/symbols/birds_eyes.svg
    description: |
          The storks are perched on ancient foundations. This represents the history of Ukraine, which
          traces its roots back to pre-Christian times. These very strong, old foundations, older than
          the history of the Russian Empire, stand in opposition to putin's claims, such as "Ukraine is a
          non-existent country" or "It is simply Little Russia ( Malorussia )."

    title: Sun and Moon
    img: /img/projects/life-force/symbols/perun.svg
    description: |
         Above the storks shines the moon, depicted as it appears on ancient Slavic amulets, representing
          the feminine principle according to ancient beliefs about nature.
          <br>
          In contrast, the sun, the masculine principle, appears on the other side in the form of a
          sunflower. Next to the sun stands <strong>Perun</strong> — the ancient supreme god of war and
          struggle, among other things. Ancient Slavic beliefs are based on duality; opposing forces.
          One is needed for the other, like yin and yang. Perhaps, even now, this is the case. To protect
          the vulnerable, it is sometimes necessary to fight.
          <br><br>
          I hope that, over time, the feminine, gentle side can once again care for the masculine, and
          the healing process can begin.

    title: Sunrise

          Amid all the darkness, I wanted to depict the sunrise, a sign of hope, because truly:
          <strong>"The darkest hour is just before dawn."</strong> This saying means that the hardest time
          comes right before things get better.
          <br><br>
          The colors of the sunrise were "transformed" and turned into ribbons, as in a traditional
          floral wreath.
          <br>
          The style in which the ribbons are painted pays homage to the significant and bold artist
          <a href="https://treasures.ui.org.ua/panchenko_ua"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            title="treasures.ui.org.ua/panchenko_ua"
            class="link">Liubov Panchenko</a>.
          This brave and important artist passed away at the age of 86 in a bunker during the occupation
          of Bucha.
