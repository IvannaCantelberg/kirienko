sectionTitle: Art in the wartime ?
description: |
            To introduce ‘why and for whom’ this project exists, and to explain the role of art, even, or perhaps even more so during wartime, 
            I’d like to share this (shortened) message exchange from Pasha:

        We returned from the battlefield for a few days.

        When I read your post about the project and the invitation for artists, I was moved to tears.

        I don’t even understand how you can create something so profound from a distance. You are doing tremendous work for Ukraine — for the whole world. 
        Even though I am not a creative person, I dream of telling people who know how to love life, peace, and the earth about you.

        Thank you, Tanya. 
        You opened my eyes — maybe even both.
