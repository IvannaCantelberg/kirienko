sectionTitle: Art in the wartime ?
description: |
            To introduce ‘why and for whom’ this project exists, and to explain the role of art, even, or perhaps even more so during wartime, 
            I’d like to share this (shortened) message exchange from Pasha:

          When I read your post on Facebook, where you invited artists to join your work, tears rolled down my cheeks. 
          I still can’t understand how you can create something like this – from such a distance – without seeing it, but still understanding it so deeply. 
          <br> <br>
          I may not be a creative person, but I dream of sharing your work and your contribution to Ukraine with people who know how to love life, the world, and the land.
          If it weren’t for everything that’s happening now, I would never have understood the value, beauty, and meaning of life. 
          <br> <br>
          Thank you, Tanja! 
          You’ve opened my eyes – maybe even both eyes.
