            As a passionate textile artist based in Arnhem, Netherlands, I warmly invite you to
            explore my captivating world of sustainable textile art. Each artwork is meticulously
            crafted from unused remnants of curtain fabrics, capturing the essence of light, color,
            and sustainability. Collaborating with talented craftswomen in Ukraine, I bring to life
            unique pieces that harness the potential of those women and infuse character into every
            creation.. Employing a technique reminiscent of stained glass, these artworks are
            delicately sewn to allow light to permeate through, resembling textile versions of
            stained glass windows.
            <br />
            <br />
            Beyond my artistic pursuits, I am deeply committed to supporting Ukraine through my
            blog,

            Here, I chronicle the daily lives of four women since the onset of the invasion, along
            with societal developments. Additionally, I engage as a speaker to further shed light on
            the situation and advocate for support.
